# Music Generation Using Deep-Learning

# Real World Problem
This case-study focuses on generating music automatically using Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). 
We do not necessarily have to be a music expert in order to generate music. Even a non expert can generate a decent quality music using RNN.
We all like to listen interesting music and if there is some way to generate music automatically, particularly decent quality music then it's a big leap in the world of music industry.

# How to Run the Model
In order to run the model you can run the file " Music_Generate.py" #it will extract music weights and give it's accuracy.
# Prerequisites
You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.
